# bash-commands
**Preview:** This repo will contain bash command examples to serve as demos for Network Administration college students.

*If in need of a lightweight Linux distro, consider [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/tour/). An online Fedora 33 bash emulator can also be found at [bellard.org/jslinux](https://bellard.org/jslinux/), although it does not contain all of the commands in this repository.*
